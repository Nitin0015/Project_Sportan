Project Sportan - Cricket Team Selection Using Data Analytics

Developed an advanced analytical framework in Power BI, leveraging performance metrics such as batting averages, strike rates, dot ball percentages, and bowling economies to select the best cricket team of 11 players.
Engineered custom DAX measures to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs), including batting and bowling averages, boundary percentages, and strike rates for specific batting positions.
Built dynamic and interactive dashboards that allowed stakeholders to filter data by player roles, match types, and performance trends for informed decision-making.
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on historical cricket datasets to identify key patterns and correlations that influenced player selection strategies.
Automated data preprocessing workflows using Power BIâ€™s scheduled refresh feature, ensuring real-time updates for dashboards and reports.
Presented findings to stakeholders through clear visualizations, enabling a data-driven approach to team selection and strategy planning.
